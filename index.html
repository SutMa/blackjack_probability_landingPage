                    Blackjack is a card game played between one player and a dealer, 
                    with the objective of having a hand value closer to 
                    21 than the dealer's without exceeding it. 
                    Players receive two initial cards and can choose 
                    to 'hit' to get more cards or 'stand' to keep their 
                    current hand. The dealer must follow specific rules, 
                    usually hitting until they have 17 or higher. 
                    Winning occurs when the player's hand is closer to 
                    21 than the dealer's without busting, with 
                    additional rewards for a blackjack (an Ace and a 
                    10-value card).
